📄 What Is a YAML File in Ansible?

In Ansible, YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is used to write playbooks, roles, inventory, and variable files. YAML is the format Ansible uses to define tasks, configurations, and orchestration steps in a human-readable way.

A typical Ansible playbook written in YAML describes:

    What machines to run on (hosts)

    What tasks to perform (e.g., install software, copy files)

    In what order
